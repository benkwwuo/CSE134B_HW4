Most of the visual changes were done in the styled crud where I tried my
best to maintain the aesthetic and theme of the blog cards. Additionally, I had the edit and delete buttons differ from the navigation buttons to differentiate them but maintained the hover and active features. 

I might have overstepped and attempted to have 3 cards per row. However, it was difficult to have all 3 cards maintain the same height given that the summary/content could vary, that will be adjusted accordingly in the future. 

Additionally, with the implementation of the card containers, the footer began to act up and would overlap with the cards and even go off center and stick to the left so I removed that from the styled crud purely for aesthetic, that will also be fixed later.
